# Codebase Design

Design **deep modules**: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface, placed at a clean seam, testable through that interface. Use this language and these principles wherever code is being designed or restructured. The aim is leverage for callers, locality for maintainers, and testability for everyone.

## Glossary

Use these terms exactly: don't substitute "component," "service," "API," or "boundary." Consistent language is the whole point.

**Module**: anything with an interface and an implementation. Deliberately scale-agnostic: a function, class, package, or tier-spanning slice. _Avoid_: unit, component, service.

**Interface**: everything a caller must know to use the module correctly: the type signature, but also invariants, ordering constraints, error modes, required configuration, and performance characteristics. _Avoid_: API, signature (too narrow, they refer only to the type-level surface).

**Implementation**: what's inside a module, its body of code. Distinct from **Adapter**: a thing can be a small adapter with a large implementation (a Postgres repo) or a large adapter with a small implementation (an in-memory fake). Reach for "adapter" when the seam is the topic; "implementation" otherwise.

**Depth**: leverage at the interface. The amount of behaviour a caller (or test) can exercise per unit of interface they have to learn. A module is **deep** when a large amount of behaviour sits behind a small interface, **shallow** when the interface is nearly as complex as the implementation.

**Seam** _(Michael Feathers)_: a place where you can alter behaviour without editing in that place; the *location* at which a module's interface lives. Where to put the seam is its own design decision, distinct from what goes behind it. _Avoid_: boundary (overloaded with DDD's bounded context).

**Adapter**: a concrete thing that satisfies an interface at a seam. Describes *role* (what slot it fills), not substance (what's inside).

**Leverage**: what callers get from depth. More capability per unit of interface they learn. One implementation pays back across N call sites and M tests.

**Locality**: what maintainers get from depth. Change, bugs, knowledge, and verification concentrate in one place rather than spreading across callers. Fix once, fixed everywhere.

## Deep vs shallow

**Deep module** = small interface + lots of implementation:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Small Interface   │  ← Few methods, simple params
├─────────────────────┤
│                     │
│  Deep Implementation│  ← Complex logic hidden
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Shallow module** = large interface + little implementation (avoid):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│       Large Interface           │  ← Many methods, complex params
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Thin Implementation            │  ← Just passes through
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

When designing an interface, ask:

- Can I reduce the number of methods?
- Can I simplify the parameters?
- Can I hide more complexity inside?

## Principles (Ousterhout & Deep Modules)

- **Depth is a property of the interface, not the implementation.** A deep module can be internally composed of small, mockable, swappable parts; they just aren't part of the interface. A module can have **internal seams** (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the **external seam** at its interface.
- **The deletion test.** Imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through. If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.** Callers and tests cross the same seam. If you want to test *past* the interface, the module is probably the wrong shape.
- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam. Two adapters means a real one.** Don't introduce a seam unless something actually varies across it.
- **Information Hiding vs Information Leakage.** Encapsulate key design decisions and knowledge inside the module. If two modules must both know a file format, data schema or internal state structure, information has leaked. Reorganise to unify the knowledge in a single deep module.
- **Proscribe Temporal Decomposition.** Never decompose code based on the execution timeline (e.g. step 1: read file, step 2: modify file, step 3: write file across three shallow classes). Group by shared knowledge, not order of execution.
- **Separate General-Purpose and Special-Purpose Code.** Pull special-purpose code (UI-specific formatting, page policies) upwards into caller layers; push general-purpose mechanisms (data operations, history tracking, queries) downwards into deep modules.
- **Define Errors (and Special Cases) Out of Existence.** Redefine operation semantics so that boundary conditions, empty collections, or idempotent deletions are standard nominal behaviour rather than exceptions or special-case branches.

## The 14 Red Flags (Complexity Signals)

Refuse or refactor code showing any of these symptoms:
1. **Shallow Module**: Interface complexity rivals implementation functionality.
2. **Information Leakage**: A design decision or data layout is reflected across multiple modules.
3. **Temporal Decomposition**: Module structure is driven by execution chronology rather than information hiding.
4. **Overexposure**: Commonly used APIs force callers to understand rarely used features or config.
5. **Pass-Through Method / Variable**: Method or variable merely forwards arguments to another layer without transforming them.
6. **Repetition**: The same structural pattern is copied instead of finding the right abstraction.
7. **Special-General Mixture**: General-purpose engine contains special-case code tailored to a single caller.
8. **Conjoined Methods**: Two methods cannot be understood or altered independently.
9. **Comment Repeats Code**: Documentation restates variable/function names without providing higher-level intent or missing constraints.
10. **Implementation Documentation Contaminates Interface**: Interface comments expose internal implementation quirks instead of the abstraction.
11. **Vague Name**: Identifier is too generic to convey precise representation or invariants.
12. **Hard to Pick Name**: Difficulty naming an entity indicates an unfocused, poorly abstracted object.
13. **Hard to Describe**: An interface needing a long, convoluted explanation hides a broken abstraction.
14. **Nonobvious Code**: The meaning or side-effects of code cannot be deduced quickly by a reader.

## Designing for testability

Good interfaces make testing natural:

1. **Accept dependencies, don't create them.**

   ```typescript
   // Testable
   function processOrder(order, paymentGateway) {}

   // Hard to test
   function processOrder(order) {
     const gateway = new StripeGateway();
   }
   ```

2. **Return results, don't produce side effects.**

   ```typescript
   // Testable
   function calculateDiscount(cart): Discount {}

   // Hard to test
   function applyDiscount(cart): void {
     cart.total -= discount;
   }
   ```

3. **Small surface area.** Fewer methods = fewer tests needed. Fewer params = simpler test setup.

## Relationships

- A **Module** has exactly one **Interface** (the surface it presents to callers and tests).
- **Depth** is a property of a **Module**, measured against its **Interface**.
- A **Seam** is where a **Module**'s **Interface** lives.
- An **Adapter** sits at a **Seam** and satisfies the **Interface**.
- **Depth** produces **Leverage** for callers and **Locality** for maintainers.

## Rejected framings

- **Depth as ratio of implementation-lines to interface-lines** (Ousterhout): rewards padding the implementation. We use depth-as-leverage instead.
- **"Interface" as the TypeScript `interface` keyword or a class's public methods**: too narrow: interface here includes every fact a caller must know.
- **"Boundary"**: overloaded with DDD's bounded context. Say **seam** or **interface**.

## Going deeper

- **Deepening a cluster given its dependencies**, see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md): dependency categories, seam discipline, and replace-don't-layer testing.
- **Exploring alternative interfaces**, see [DESIGN-IT-TWICE.md](DESIGN-IT-TWICE.md): spin up parallel sub-agents to design the interface several radically different ways, then compare on depth, locality, and seam placement.
